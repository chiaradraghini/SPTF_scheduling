# SPTF_scheduling
The primary objective of this project was to implement the M/G/1 queuing system with the Shortest Processing Time First discipline in the OMNeT++ simulation environment. 
The aim was to achieve the following goals:
- Simulate the behavior of the queuing system under the defined conditions;
- Collect statistics on various performance metrics, including average general and
conditional queuing times, average response time, server utilization factor and queue
length over time;
- Conduct a comparative analysis between the experimental results obtained through
simulation and the theoretical values derived from queuing theory formulas.

The actual implementation of the desired logic involved implementing a queue sorting mechanism and its detailed implementation can be found within the “Queue.cc” file.
The results of the project are included as “.csv” files in the ”result” folder. 
The visualization and analysis of said results is available in the "Project_Report.pdf".
